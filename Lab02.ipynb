    "In the serene village of Arithmetica, numbers were not just symbols; they were living entities that coexisted in perfect harmony. Each number had a distinct personality, contributing to the village's balance and order. But occasionally, the numbers would come together for a special event called the Harmony Gathering. During the harmony gathering, the event starts with identifying their Five Point Summary or Descriptive Statistics. \n",
